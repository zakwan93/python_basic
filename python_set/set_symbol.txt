math set

| or .union(*others) - all of the items from all of the sets
& or .intersection(*others) - all of the common items between all of the sets
- or .difference(*others) - all of the items in the first set that are not in the other sets
^ or .symmetric_difference(other) - all of the items that are not shared by the two sets
(also: notice how those are using *others? That's a tuple of other sets. See, I told you that pattern was everywhere!)
