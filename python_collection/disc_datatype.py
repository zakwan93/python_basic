# challenge_1
# Make a dictionary named player and add two keys to it. 
# The first key should be "name" and the value can be any string you want.
# The second key should be "remaining_lives". 
# Set this key's value to 3.

player = {"name": "Zakwan", "remaining_lives": 3}

# challenge_2
# Now add a "levels" key. It should be a list with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 in it.
# And, lastly, add an "items" key. 
# This key's value should be another dictionary. 
# Give it at least one key and value, but they can be anything you want.

player = {"name": "Zakwan", "remaining_lives": 3, "levels": [1,2,3,4], "items":{"play":"cricket"} }
