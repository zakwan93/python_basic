# Facts about Tuples
# 1. Tuples are immutable. you can't change it.
# 2. memory efficient 

# simple tuple example 
# Tuple make with paranthasis and comma

my_tuples = (1,2,3)

# one point to note here that LIST are mutable in tuple
example

my_list_tuple = (1,"zakwan",[2,3,6])
# if I tried to change 1st index which is number I'll get a item assignment error
my_list_tuple[0] = 5

# same thing with string too

# but we can make a change in list in tuple but can't remove anything from list
my_list_tuple[2][1] = [4]

# this will chnage list into [2,4,6]
